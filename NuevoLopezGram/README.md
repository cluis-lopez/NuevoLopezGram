New version of an old project

This is a simple Social Network where users may:

- Register
- Post text and/or multimedia (pictures/videos) messages
- Comment posts
- etc.


The main goal is not to defeat Facebook and get Mark Zuckerberg asking for food in Palo Alto corners but autotraining in Spring Boot (backend) and AngularJS (frontend)

As usual, the app is deployed in Google Cloud using Datastore as backend database but as I'm using JPA/Spring, change the data source to a different provider (SQL or not) should be quite easy.
